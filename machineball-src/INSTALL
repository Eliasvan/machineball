Machine Ball   Version 1.0

This is the source code of Machine Ball. Prepare to compile...
This is going to be difficult. I recommend that you download
the generic Machine Ball binary from:
http://benny.kramekweb.com/machineball

But if you're using a different architecture, or are just one
of those paranoid people who only compile software from source,
then read on...

First of all, we need to install the libraries that Machine Ball
needs:


-----------------------------------------------
1) Allegro
-----------------------------------------------
http://alleg.sourceforge.net

You'll need at least version 4.0.2
I recommend the stable release. There is an "Allegro End-User"
download. I'm not sure if this will work. I don't recommend it

  ./configure
  make
  su
  make install


-----------------------------------------------
2) AllegroGL
-----------------------------------------------
http://allegrogl.sourceforge.net

You'll need at least version 0.1.12

  ./configure
  make
  su
  make install


-----------------------------------------------
3) DUMB
-----------------------------------------------
http://dumb.sourceforge.net

You'll need at least version 0.9.1
(These build instructions might not work for later versions.
Read the DUMB docs if this doesn't work)

  ./fix.sh unix
  ./makeall.sh
  su
  ./makeall.sh


-----------------------------------------------
4) ODE
-----------------------------------------------
http://www.q12.org/ode

You'll need at least version 0.35 (This hasn't been released yet.
Until the release, you must use CVS:

When prompted for a password, enter "anonymous" (without the quotes)

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@q12.org:/cvsroot login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@q12.org:/cvsroot co ode

)

  cp config/user-settings.example config/user-settings
!!! Edit the file config/user-settings, make sure that the settings are correct
    (The defaults should be fine)
  make ode-lib
  su
  cp -r include/ode /usr/local/include
  cp lib/libode.a /usr/local/lib


-----------------------------------------------
--------- THAT'S IT! --------------------------
-----------------------------------------------

After you set up all those libraries. Enter the Machine Ball
directory and type:

  make

During the build, you will see this message

 I don't know how to do constructor functions on this platform, so you must
 call fixup_datafile() before using this data! (after setting a video mode).

You can ignore it.
The supplied Makefile should work without changes for pretty much any unix
based system. You may have to change the "gcc" command in line 4 to your linker

If you want to install the game system wide:

  su
  cp machineball /usr/local/bin
(You can copy it to any other directory in your PATH)

And there you go! Just type machineball at the prompt, find a friend
and start playing!
